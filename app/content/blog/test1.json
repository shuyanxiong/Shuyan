The results verify that the dominant frequency components of both cardiac and pulmonary sounds have an overlap region of 20 Hz to 60 Hz. The results of cross-correlation of the signals provide evidence for the localization of broadband sound sources, which originate from the closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves and are located around the 4th rib cartilage. The manufacturing of the transducer, the fabrication of the PCB board used for data acquisition, and the code compilation for data post-processing are all done independently. The signal result of heart sound separation was successfully obtained and cross-correlation values were mapped over the chest diagram to provide evidence of the location of the heart sound source.",
