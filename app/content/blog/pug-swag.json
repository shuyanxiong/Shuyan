The solid customized insole model was first generated and simulated in ANSYS for stress analysis. The simulation results confirm that the customized insole does average the pressure distribution and reduces the peak plantar pressure. Von-Mises stress results provide a way to define the voronoi lattice structure by selecting the appropriate points in Rhinoceros. The heterogeneous structure is enclosed by thickened shells, 3D prototyping validated the feasibility of the complete workflow.\n\n  [![](https://26808843.s21i.faiusr.com/4/ABUIABAEGAAgg6HQhgYo8dfupgYw4wM47QI.png.webp)](<>)\n\n  **SIMULATION >>>**\n\n  [![](https://26808843.s21i.faiusr.com/4/ABUIABAEGAAg9ZvQhgYo5K7qnAMwugQ4-wE.png.webp)](<>)\n\n  **OPTIMIZATION >>>**\n\n  [![](https://26808843.s21i.faiusr.com/4/ABUIABAEGAAg85vQhgYoiMv9jQYwjwo4hQQ.png.webp)](<>)\n\n  **PROTOTYPING**",
